# Unit-4-Game - Crystal Collector
##### Homework Assignment 4: Recommended - jQuery

This is a fun and interactive game for web browsers, made using HTML and CSS.  (The Challenging Version (Star Wars RPG) can be found on my [Portfolio](https://sasquatchxyz.github.io/Basic-Portfolio/)).  For this game the objective is to guess the Target Score number (which is randomized on Game Start), using the values for the different gemstones to add up their score.  The gemstones change values with each new game.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The only thing you need to enjoy the fun of the game is a web browser.

### Installing

No installation necessary.  Unless you don't have a web browser... in which case I question your ability to view this in the first place.
